# homebridge-philipstv-older-models
Homebridge module for Philips TV (with JointSpace enabled) 
This package targets 2012 and below models which has not "powerstate" implemented.

# Description

This plugin is basically a modification of homebridge-http.
Main difference is:
- Ability to poll every 5 min a PhilipsTV
- Ability to sent on Standbye command
- If no answer is received, the power state is set to false
- If any answer is received, the power state is set to true

# Update
Added power-on function for models after 2014 (thanks to uronito - https://github.com/uronito )
